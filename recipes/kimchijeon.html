    <h2>A little about kimchijeon</h2>
    <p>Kimchi pancakes (aka kimchijeon) are as easy to make as their breakfast/serve-with-maple-syrup counterparts. Unlike Chinese scallion pancakes, which require you to make a dough, these pancakes are made from a simpler batter.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Pancake</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup potato starch</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup cabbage kimchi <i>roughly chopped</i></li>
        <li>½ cup kimchi juice</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 scallion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the Dipping Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to make Kimchijeon (steps)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, potato starch, and salt until combined. Add the kimchi, kimchi juice, water, and scallion. Use a pair of chopsticks or a fork to stir the mixture until well-combined</li>
        <li>Heat a nonstick or cast iron pan over medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons vegetable oil and add the batter to the pan, spreading it in an even layer. Fry until browned on one side.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake and continue to cook until browned on the other side.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, assemble the dipping sauce by combining the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. </li>
        <li>Serve alongside the pancake!</li>
    </ol>
