    <h2>A little about Japchae</h2>
    <p>Seasoned simply with soy sauce, sesame oil, and sugar, japchae is a noodle dish perfect for a light lunch or dinner–i.e., when you want something satisfying but not too heavy, and/or are tired of an endless parade of salads.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>170g flank steak <i>cut into thin strips</i></li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
        <li>6 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>4½ tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 onion <i>sliced thinly</i></li>
        <li>2 carrots <i>julienned</i></li>
        <li>1 small red bell pepper</li>
        <li>115g baby spinach</li>
        <li>3 scallions</li>
        <li>280g potato starch noodles</li>
        <li>vegetable oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Make Japchae (steps)</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the beef together with 1 clove of the garlic, 1 teaspoon sugar, ¼ teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Prepare the vegetables, and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook the noodles for 7 minutes in a large pot of boiling water. Strain and cut with scissors so that they’re a little shorter. Add 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, and 2 teaspoons sugar to the noodles. Toss thoroughly.</li>
        <li>Heat up a skillet over medium high heat. Stir-fry the onion and carrot with 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil until tender, but still a little crunchy. Transfer to a large mixing bowl. </li>
        <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan, and add the mushrooms. 
        <li>Cook until caramelized, and transfer to the mixing bowl along with the onion and carrot.</li>
        <li>Add another tablespoon of oil to the pan, and cook the red peppers until tender.</li> 
        <li>Add in the spinach, scallions, and the remaining garlic. Cook the entire mixture until the scallions and spinach are wilted. Transfer to the mixing bowl with the other vegetables.</li>
        <li>Turn up your heat to high, and add the beef to the pan. Stir-fry for a couple minutes until the beef is no longer pink. Transfer the noodles and the beef to the mixing bowl, along with the sesame seeds.</li>
        <li>Add 3 teaspoons sugar, ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, 2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce, and 1 tablespoon of sesame oil to the mixing bowl full of ingredients. Toss to combine all the ingredients together.</li>
        <li>Serve!</li>
